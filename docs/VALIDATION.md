## Phase 0 Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pwd` | `/mnt/c/Workspace/Codex/file-translation` |
| `ls -la` | Only `.git` exists. |
| `rg --files -uu` | Only `.git` internals found. |
| `git status --short --branch` | No commits yet on `main`; `origin/main` is gone. |
| `git branch --show-current` | `main` |
| `git remote -v` | `origin` points to `git@github.com:Petooooo/file-translation.git`. |
| `git log --oneline --decorate --max-count=5` | Failed as expected because there are no commits. |
| `docker --version` | Docker `29.5.3` installed. |
| `docker info` | Docker Desktop server reachable. |
| `docker compose version` | Docker Compose `v5.1.4` installed. |
| `kubectl version --client` | Client `v1.34.1`; Kustomize `v5.7.1`. |
| `kubectl config current-context` | `docker-desktop` |
| `kubectl config get-contexts` | Only `docker-desktop` context listed. |
| `kubectl cluster-info` | Failed: connection refused to `https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443`. |
| `helm version --short` | Failed: `helm` command not found. |
| `k3s --version` | Failed: `k3s` command not found. |
| `k3d version` | Failed: `k3d` command not found. |
| `kind version` | Failed: `kind` command not found. |
| `uname -a` | WSL2 Linux kernel `6.6.114.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2`. |

## Current Validation Summary

- Repository is empty enough for initial planning docs.
- Docker is usable.
- kubectl client exists, but no reachable Kubernetes API is available.
- Helm and local-cluster tools must be installed before Helm deployment validation.

## Known Gaps

- No Helm chart exists yet.
- No MinIO, RabbitMQ, or PostgreSQL instance has been deployed yet.
- Phase 2 services are skeletons only; they do not connect to RabbitMQ, MinIO, or PostgreSQL yet.

## Phase 1 Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `bash -n scripts/dev/check-env.sh` | Passed. |
| `bash -n scripts/dev/bootstrap-cluster.sh` | Passed. |
| `bash -n scripts/dev/smoke-test.sh` | Passed. |
| `scripts/dev/bootstrap-cluster.sh --help` | Passed; printed usage and configurable environment variables. |
| `scripts/dev/smoke-test.sh --help` | Passed; printed usage and DNS smoke-test variables. |
| `scripts/dev/check-env.sh` | Failed as expected on this PC: Docker and kubectl passed; Helm and k3d missing; Kubernetes API not reachable. |
| `scripts/dev/bootstrap-cluster.sh` | Failed as expected: `k3d is required`. |
| `scripts/dev/smoke-test.sh` | Failed as expected: current `docker-desktop` Kubernetes API refused connection. |
| `command -v shellcheck` | Failed: `shellcheck` is not installed, so only Bash syntax validation was run. |

## Phase 1 Validation Summary

- Local dev scripts were added and syntax-checked.
- `check-env.sh` correctly reports installed and missing prerequisites.
- `bootstrap-cluster.sh` blocks before attempting cluster creation because k3d is missing.
- `smoke-test.sh` blocks because no reachable Kubernetes API exists.
- Namespace and DNS validation are still pending until Helm and k3d are installed and the local cluster is bootstrapped.

## Phase 1 Initial Blocker

This blocker was resolved on 2026-06-09 23:52 KST. Historical install commands used:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-4
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

scripts/dev/check-env.sh
scripts/dev/bootstrap-cluster.sh
scripts/dev/smoke-test.sh
```

## Phase 1 Blocker Resolution Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `sudo -n true` | Failed: password required; avoided system-wide install. |
| `HELM_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" /tmp/get_helm.sh --no-sudo` | Installed Helm binary; official script returned non-zero because zsh PATH did not include `~/.local/bin`. |
| `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" helm version --short` | Passed: `v4.2.0+g0646808`. |
| `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" K3D_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" /tmp/install_k3d.sh --no-sudo` | Passed. |
| `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" k3d version` | Passed: k3d `v5.9.0`; k3d default k3s line is `v1.35.5-k3s1`. |
| `docker manifest inspect rancher/k3s:v1.32.13-k3s1` | Passed after one retry. |
| `scripts/dev/check-env.sh` | Passed after install; Helm and k3d detected; existing Docker Desktop API warning remained before k3d context was created. |
| `scripts/dev/bootstrap-cluster.sh` | Passed; created `file-translation-dev` with k3s `v1.32.13+k3s1` and namespace `file-translation`. |
| `scripts/dev/smoke-test.sh` | Passed; nodes Ready, namespace exists, CoreDNS exists, busybox DNS lookup succeeded. |
| `scripts/dev/check-env.sh` | Passed after cluster creation; Kubernetes API reachable on context `k3d-file-translation-dev`. |

## Phase 1 Resolved Local State

- Helm `v4.2.0` installed at `/home/peto/.local/bin/helm`.
- k3d `v5.9.0` installed at `/home/peto/.local/bin/k3d`.
- Project scripts prepend `~/.local/bin` to PATH when it exists.
- Current kubectl context: `k3d-file-translation-dev`.
- Nodes:
  - `k3d-file-translation-dev-server-0`: Ready, k3s `v1.32.13+k3s1`.
  - `k3d-file-translation-dev-agent-0`: Ready, k3s `v1.32.13+k3s1`.
- Namespace `file-translation` is Active.
- Cluster DNS resolved `kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local` to `10.43.0.1` from a temporary busybox pod.

## Phase 2 Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 --version` | Python `3.10.12` used for host-side tests. |
| `python3 -m compileall -q services tests` | Passed. |
| `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` | Passed: 11 tests. |
| `scripts/dev/smoke-services.sh` | Passed: all 8 service smoke commands. |
| `scripts/dev/build-images.sh` | Passed: all 8 images built with tag `0.1.0`. |
| `scripts/dev/smoke-images.sh` | Passed: all 8 image smoke commands. |
| `docker image inspect ...` | Passed; local image IDs recorded in `docs/IMAGE_INVENTORY.md`. |
| `docker push petoo/file-translation-job-service:0.1.0` | Failed: `denied: requested access to the resource is denied`; no images were pushed. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed before commit. |

## Phase 2 Validation Summary

- `job-service` has `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/config` handlers covered by tests.
- All workers have smoke commands and long-running no-op container entrypoints.
- Config loading is environment-driven and excludes secret values from safe output.
- MinIO object key convention is implemented as pure helper functions and covered by tests.
- Docker images use namespace `petoo` and explicit tag `0.1.0`.
- Registry digests are not available because Docker Hub push was denied.
